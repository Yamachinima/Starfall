ADVANCED TANK TURRET - WIRING INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================

[ WIRE INPUTS ]
* Base (ENTITY)         : Wire to the main physical chassis/hull of the tank.
* Torso (ENTITY)        : Wire to the physical turret prop that sits on the base.
* LeftGun (ENTITY)      : Wire to the left main gun prop.
* RightGun (ENTITY)     : Wire to the right main gun prop.
* Seat (ENTITY)         : Wire to the driver's vehicle seat/pod.
* FPV_Prop (ENTITY)     : Wire to an invisible prop placed where the first-person camera should be.
* TPV_Prop (ENTITY)     : Wire to an invisible prop placed where the third-person camera should be.
* ViewMode (NORMAL)     : Wire to a toggle (e.g., Wire Button or Pod Controller) to switch camera modes.
* LeftSentry (ENTITY)   : Wire to the left AI sentry base prop.
* RightSentry (ENTITY)  : Wire to the right AI sentry base prop.
* LeftMinigun (ENTITY)  : Wire to the spinning barrel prop on the left sentry.
* RightMinigun (ENTITY) : Wire to the spinning barrel prop on the right sentry.
* SentryEnable (NORMAL) : Wire to a toggle switch to turn the AI targeting on/off.

[ WIRE OUTPUTS ]
* CamPos (VECTOR)       : Wire to the Cam Controller's Position input.
* CamAng (ANGLE)        : Wire to the Cam Controller's Angle input.
* Active (NORMAL)       : Wire to the Cam Controller's Activated input (links camera to seat occupancy).
* CamParent (ENTITY)    : Optional. Use if dynamically swapping camera parenting via external logic.
* LeftFire (NORMAL)     : Wire to the firing mechanism (e.g., Turret tool or Emitter) for the left sentry.
* RightFire (NORMAL)    : Wire to the firing mechanism for the right sentry.

[ INSTALLATION WORKFLOW ]
1. Spawn your physical constraints (Base, Torso, Guns, Sentries).
2. Ensure props that need to rotate (Torso, Guns, Minigun barrels) have proper spherical/axis ballsocket constraints so they don't fight the physics engine when the chip sets their angles.
3. Place the StarfallEx chip containing the code onto the Base.
4. Equip the Wire tool and strictly follow the input list above, linking the chip's inputs to their respective entities on the contraption.
5. Link your weapons and camera controllers to the chip's outputs.
6. Trigger the SentryEnable input to initialize the radar loop.
